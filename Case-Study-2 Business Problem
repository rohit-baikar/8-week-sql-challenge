🍕 Case Study 2 – Pizza Runner
  This case study is part of Danny Ma’s 8 Week SQL Challenge.
📊 Business Problem
  Danny was scrolling through his Instagram feed when something really caught his eye:
  “80s Retro Styling and Pizza Is The Future!”
  Inspired by the idea, Danny launched Pizza Runner, a pizza delivery startup that combines retro vibes with an Uber-style delivery model.
  To scale the business, Danny needs data-driven insights into:
    Order volume and customer behavior
    Runner efficiency and delivery performance  
    Ingredient usage and optimization
    Pricing, revenue, and runner costs
    Customer satisfaction via delivery ratings
Danny has shared a sample dataset that captures customer orders, runner deliveries, pizza recipes, and toppings.
The goal of this case study is to clean the data, apply calculations, and generate insights to help optimize Pizza Runner’s operations.
