# Case Study 1 – Danny's Diner 🍜
This case study is part of Danny Ma's **8 Week SQL Challenge**.

## 📊 Business Problem
Danny wants to better understand his customers’ visiting patterns, spending behavior, and favorite menu items.
These insights will help him improve personalization and decide whether to expand his customer loyalty program.
For this case study, Danny has shared sample customer data (due to privacy constraints), which is sufficient to write fully functional SQL queries and generate basic datasets for analysis.
The analysis is based on three core tables:
sales
menu
members

## ✅ Questions Solved
1. What is the total amount each customer spent at the restaurant?
2. How many days has each customer visited the restaurant?
3. What was the first item from the menu purchased by each customer?
4. What is the most purchased item on the menu and how many times was it purchased by all customers?
5. Which item was the most popular for each customer?
6. Which item was purchased first by the customer after they became a member?
7. Which item was purchased just before the customer became a member?
8. What is the total items and amount spent for each member before they became a member?
9. If each $1 spent equates to 10 points and sushi has a 2x points multiplier - how many points would each customer have?
10. In the first week after a customer joins the program (including their join date) they earn 2x points on all items, not just sushi - how many points do customer A and B have at the end of January?

-- Join the columns (customer_id, order_date, product_name, price, member(if customer order before join_date then 'N' else 'Y'), ranking(add rank))--
